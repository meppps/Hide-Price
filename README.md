# Hide-Price

This is a script for Wordpress. It checks for and hides the price for specific items and adds an 'Add to cart to see price' label. 
It works specifically with woo-commerece and a theme that has the corresponding elements. Since it's lightweight, it can run
on any page without bogging down the loading times and also checks each page to see if it needs to hide the price or not.
